Setup a new Jenkins pipeline
----------------------------

In this lab, we will create a new pipeline called **class2-master** on *Jenkins*.

Access Jenkins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Connect to *Jenkins*. It should be http://<IP of your VM>:1180/

* Login: TenantA
* Password: Pa55w0rd

.. note:: If you use UDF (F5 private cloud), you can either use the RDP Jumphost to access *Jenkins*
    or the shortcut in the interface

Once you're authenticated, you should see something like this: 

.. image:: ../../_static/class2/module2/img002.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 50%

Since we already have some pipeline working with our *GitLab* server, some configuration has already 
been made. The main item is how to authenticate with *GitLab*. To review this setup, click on 
**Manage Jenkins** and then **Configure System**.

Scroll down to the **Gitlab** section. You'll see that we have already setup a *GitLab* connection 
called **local gitlab**. We will use this connection name later in our new *pipeline*.

.. note:: You can see here that we referenced a credential called **GitLAb API token**. This token was 
    created in *GitLab*. To generate an *API Token*, in *GitLab* go to your *User Settings* once you're 
    authenticated as **TenantA**. 

    .. image:: ../../_static/class2/module2/img011.png
        :align: center
        :scale: 50%

    Select the **Access Tokens** and you'll see the *API Token* we referenced in *Jenkins*

Create a new pipeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a new pipeline, click on the **New Item** link. 

.. image:: ../../_static/class2/module2/img003.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 50%

Setup the following: 

* Item name: *class2-pipeline*
* Select *Pipeline*

.. image:: ../../_static/class2/module2/img004.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 50%

Click **OK**. 

Here we setup the following: 

* Check **github project**. 

    * *Project url*: http://<your VM IP>:1080/TenantA/Class2 
    * *Gitlab Connection*: Select **local gitlab** 

    .. image:: ../../_static/class2/module2/img005.png
        :align: center
        :scale: 50%

* In the *Build Triggers* section, check **Build when a change is pushed to 
  GitLab. GitLab webhook URL: http://172.18.0.3:8080/project/class2-pipeline**. 
  We will need to setup this *WebHook* later in *GitLab*

    * Click on the *Advanced* button. Pay attention that we decide to let all 
      the branches trigger this *pipeline*. We could create a custom *pipeline* per 
      branch if if was needed. 

    .. image:: ../../_static/class2/module2/img006.png
        :align: center
        :scale: 50%

* In the *Pipeline* section, Select **Pipeline script from SCM**. Keep the 
  default value. The *Script Path* field is to mention a **File Name** that 
  *Jenkins* will look for into our repo to know what it needs to do. We will 
  have to create this file later. Here it will look for a file called **Jenkinsfile**

  .. image:: ../../_static/class2/module2/img007.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 50%

* Click on **Apply/Save**. Your pipeline has been created. 

  .. image:: ../../_static/class2/module2/img008.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 50%

We still need to do two things: 

* Create a *WebHook* in *GitLab* to trigger our *pipeline* when our repo is updated
* add a *Jenkinsfile* to our *GitLab* repo to details what we need to do when our pipeline 
  is triggered

Setup our GitLab Webhook 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create the *WebHook*, connect to your *GitLab* GUI. 

.. note:: reminder to login into *GitLab*

    * Login: TenantA
    * Password: Pa55w0rd

.. image:: ../../_static/class2/module2/img013.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 50%

Click on your repo **TenantA / Class 2**. Click on **Settings** > **Integrations**.

When we created our **class2-pipeline**, we saw the following during its setup: 

.. image:: ../../_static/class2/module2/img006.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 50%

This is the URL we should use as our *WebHook*: http://172.18.0.3:8080/project/class2-pipeline.
In the *GitLab* GUI:

* use this URL in the *URL* field. 
* leave *Secret Token* empty. 
* uncheck *Enable SSL verification*

Click the **Add webhook** button. Once it's saved, you should see the following (you may need to 
scroll down). 

.. image:: ../../_static/class2/module2/img015.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 50%

You can test your *WebHook*Â by clicking on the **Test** button and select **Push events**. 

.. image:: ../../_static/class2/module2/img016.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 50%

You should see the following: 

* a Blue banner on the *GitLab* GUI: 

    .. image:: ../../_static/class2/module2/img017.png
        :align: center
        :scale: 50%

* If you go back to the *Jenkins* GUI. You will see a red icon and 
    "stormy" cloud next our **class2-pipeline** pipeline. It means that the pipeline 
    failed. This is expected and it shows that it got triggered by our *WebHook* test.  

    .. image:: ../../_static/class2/module2/img018.png

    |

    Click on the **class2-pipeline** link and then click on the latest build history number. It 
    should be #1

    Click on **Console Output** to see what happens with this *build*.

    You'll see the output related to our *pipeline* being executed

    .. code:: 

        Started by GitLab push by TenantA
        [Office365connector] No webhooks to notify
        Lightweight checkout support not available, falling back to full checkout.
        Checking out hudson.scm.NullSCM into /var/jenkins_home/workspace/class2-pipeline@script to read Jenkinsfile
        [Office365connector] No webhooks to notify
        ERROR: /var/jenkins_home/workspace/class2-pipeline@script/Jenkinsfile not found
        Finished: FAILURE

    Here you can see that the ERROR is related to the fact that we haven't yet created the **Jenkinsfile** in our
    repository. 

We will setup the Jenkinsfile in our next lab.
