Module 1 - Review the setup 
===========================

In this module, we will show you how to do a demo of IaC (*Infrastructure as Code*) 
with F5 solutions: 

* We will use GitLab to host our application definition and 
  also services tied to it : ADC and Web Application Firewall services
* We will trigger our CI/CD pipeline by updating our Gitlab repo 
* We will monitor how our application is deployed. 
* We will ensure that the relevant ADC services are deployed on our BIG-IP

To do this demo, we need to get a proper understanding of the setup. 

Through Module1, you'll review the overall setup and be able to trigger a demo of IaC
