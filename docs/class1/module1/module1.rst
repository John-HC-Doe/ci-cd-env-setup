Module 1 - Review the setup 
===========================

In this module, we will show how to do a demonstration of IaC: 

* We will use GitLab to host our application definition and also services tied to it :
    ADC and Web Application Firewall services
* We will trigger our CI/CD pipeline by updating Gitlab 
* We will monitor how our application is deployed. 

To do this demo, we need to get a proper understanding of the setup.
